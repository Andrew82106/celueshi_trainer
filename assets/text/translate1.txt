A Devon entrepreneur who appeared on hit BBC show Dragons’ Den has secured investment for his coffee company after a successful pitch.

Will Little, who owns family-run Little’s Coffee, was looking for £80,000 for 2% of his Cullompton-based business and received four offers from the dragons. The second-generation business owner finally agreed a deal with investor Steven Bartlett for 5% of his company - for the full amount of money.
